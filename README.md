## Instructions
* Rebase master branch to your name branch
* Check the log of your branch and remove all the commits with the word `delete or remove`
* Take all the commits of your branch (no the first commit) and make them a single commit.
* Talk with the others and make a plan to merge or rebase your own branch to master. In the end, the single file should contain a text that makes a perfect sense.
